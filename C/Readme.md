C is the compiler based language where the compiler used to compile your code into machine instructions

To compile your code simply run terminal and write:  
    gcc filename.c

The compiler will generate an .exe file which is an executable file and now you can easily run that file to get your output
write: 
    ./executable_name.exe

congratulations your file run successfully


C was developed by Dennis Ritchie at Bell laboratories, USA in 1972

For C programming we need an compiler to convert our code into machine instructions which is windows executable file. Download an any compiler for the internet we are using MinGW gcc compiler.
download and install it and make installation of gcc++ component to run our C programs

Variables:
    Variables are the containers to store data with perticular name. so, that we can use it in overall program.
Declaration of variable is nothing but naming the container where the value is going to store

Rule to declare variable: 
    - Variable name should start with alphabet or underscore
    - Variable name should not start with number
    - Variable name should not contain any special character
    - Variable name should not be reserved word
    - Variable name should not be same as any other variable name
    - Variable name should not be same as any system keyword
    - Variable name should not be same as any function name
    - Variable name should not be same as any built in function name

Reserved keywords of C:
    auto    double  int     struct  break   long    else    switch  case    return  enum    typedef char    register        extern  typedef char    register    extern  union   const   short   float   unsigned    continue    signed  for void    default sizeof  goto    volatile    do  static  if      while

Constants:
    constants is entity whose value does not changes


Header file:
    The header file is main file that you need to add to your boiler plate to run your code. It contains list functions and it's instructions that we are going to use in our code.
    We can call it as a C library also

HAPPY COADING
