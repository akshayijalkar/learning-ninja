C is the compiler based language where the compiler used to compile your code into machine instructions

To compile your code simply run terminal and write:  gcc filename.c
The compiler will generate an .exe file which is an executable file and now you can easily run that file to get your output
write: ./executable_name.exe

congratulations your file run successfully

HAPPY COADING
